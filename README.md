# ALEX (Artificial Life EXperiment)
A game I designed for my Commodore 128 back in the day, but I didn't really have the programming chops back then to make it work. 
Now I'm finishing it in Python with some basic terminal graphics, at least for now until I can get the play mechanics where I want them.
